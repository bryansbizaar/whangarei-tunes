        Welcome! Weâ€™re a collection of musos in the Whangarei area who enjoy
        playing acoustic trad folk and roots music. We host a weekly session
        class that teaches tunes, musicianship and etiquette. We also host an
        advanced session weekly that showcases many tunes included here. Our
        backgrounds are as diverse as our repertoire which includes new and old
        tunes from around the world. This site is a place to discover new music
        and to grow a common repertoire in the community. There are many
        standards included, as well as unique and interesting pieces that are
        reflective of our individual tastes. Many of these tunes can be found by
        searching at thesession.org, irish.session.nz, Spotify or YouTube (to
        name a few). Explore, expand, and see you out there!
